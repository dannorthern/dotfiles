# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

## Setup

To get started, run `./setup`, which will do the following:

1. Install Homebrew and all the applications and tools listed in the Brewfile.
2. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js using nvm.
3. Install Lando (for local development).
4. Install Oh My Zsh and the Spaceship theme.
5. Append the NVM configuration to .zshrc.
